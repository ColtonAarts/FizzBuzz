# FizzBuzz

To run this code you will need either need to download the repo as a zip file or clone with git.

If you clone and use the Git Bash terminal on Windows you will need to navigate to a folder where you want to store the repo. Initialize the folder using git init. Then use git clone https://github.com/ColtonAarts/FizzBuzz.git. After this you will need to make sure that the path is set for your javac complier. When this is set you will need to cd into the FizzBuzz folder and run javac Main.java. After this run java Main.
